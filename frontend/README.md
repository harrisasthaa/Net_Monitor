# Build Web Interface


### How to Build?
Download the source code, install requirements, and build the project.  
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/phxnet/monitor.git
cd monitor/frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

### How to Setup Front-end?
If installation goes successfully it will create a ```dist/``` directory, which contains ```index.html``` file and ```static``` folder. Provide the ```/dist``` folder as a root path of your web-server.
